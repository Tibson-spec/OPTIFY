## **Insights & Recommendations**

### **Key Insights:**
- The unemployment rate in India shows significant regional variation, Tripura has the highest at around 28.35%, followed by Haryana and Jharkhand. Other regions with high unemployment include Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, and Delhi, with the rates decreasing as you go down the list.
- Urban areas tend to have higher unemployment rates compared to rural areas, possibly due to better low access to jobs and industries during pandemic.
- A moderate positive correlation exists between labor participation rate and employment, indicating that higher labor participation generally correlates with higher employment.
- By aggregating the unemployment rate over time, the plot identifies how unemployment changes on a monthly basis. The time series plot can reveal trends such as peak in mid 2020s, unemployment periods, seasonal variations, or long-term downward/upward trends.
- By calculating and plotting monthly average unemployment rates, unemployment rates tend to rise in April and May, but falls drastically in july.
- The correlation matrix gives a deeper understanding of how the unemployment rate is related to employment but is independent in correlation with labor participation.
- Bar chart compares employment levels in rural and urban regions. Rural areas consistently have a higher number of employed individuals than urban areas. Both regions experience seasonal employment spikes, but rural areas show a significantly larger workforce.

### **Recommendations:**
- Focus on boosting employment in high-unemployment regions through targeted government initiatives and private sector engagement.
- Policies aimed at improving rural employment and skill development should be prioritized.
- Analyzing monthly and seasonal trends could help identify the best periods for job creation and workforce mobilization.

# TASK 3
# Iris Flower Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Problem Statement

The task is to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their physical measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The three species of Iris flowers in the dataset are:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify these flowers into their respective species based on their given features. This is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and serves as an introductory problem for classification tasks.

---

## Solution Approach

### 1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
We begin by using the **Iris dataset** which is already available in the `scikit-learn` library. The dataset includes the following attributes:

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

These attributes are used as features to classify the target species, which are:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

### 2. **Data Exploration**
After loading the dataset, we conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure. We look at the first few rows of the dataset and check for any missing values or inconsistencies. Additionally, we map the target integer values to species names for better readability.

### 3. **Data Splitting**
We split the dataset into training and testing sets. 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% is reserved for testing the modelâ€™s performance. This is a common practice to ensure that the model is evaluated on unseen data.

### 4. **Feature Scaling**
Since Support Vector Machines (SVM) are sensitive to the scale of the data, we apply **StandardScaler** to normalize the features. This step ensures that the features have zero mean and unit variance, which leads to better model performance.

### 5. **Model Training**
We use the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier with a **linear kernel**. SVM is a powerful algorithm for classification problems and is well-suited for datasets like Iris that have clear boundaries between classes.

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
After training the model, we evaluate its performance on the test set using several metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified instances.
- **Classification Report**: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix that shows the actual vs predicted classifications for each species.

Additionally, we visualize the **confusion matrix** using **seaborn** for better interpretation of the results.

### 7. **Visualization of Decision Boundaries** (Optional)
To gain further insights into how the model is making decisions, we reduce the data to two dimensions using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and visualize the decision boundaries in a 2D plot.

## Code Implementation

```python
# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()

# Convert the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for better readability
df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
df['species'] = iris.target

# Map the target integer values to species names
df['species'] = df['species'].map({0: 'setosa', 1: 'versicolor', 2: 'virginica'})

# Separate the features (X) and target (y)
X = df.drop('species', axis=1)  # Features
y = df['species']              # Target

# Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Normalize the data using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Initialize the Support Vector Machine classifier (SVC)
svm = SVC(kernel='linear', random_state=42)

# Train the model
svm.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = svm.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Generate a classification report
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Confusion matrix
print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(conf_matrix)

# Plot confusion matrix using seaborn
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues", xticklabels=iris.target_names, yticklabels=iris.target_names)
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('True')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

## Insights and Results

- **Accuracy**: The model achieved an accuracy of around **100%** on the Iris dataset. This is because the Iris dataset is well-separated, making it easy for the SVM to classify the species correctly.
  
- **Classification Report**: The classification report shows that the model has a **precision** and **recall** of 1.00 for all species, which means it made no errors in classifying any of the flowers.

- **Confusion Matrix**: The confusion matrix shows that all the samples were classified correctly, with no misclassifications. This is a good indication of the model's effectiveness on this dataset.

## Challenges

While the model achieved excellent performance on this dataset, there are a few challenges worth mentioning:
- **Overfitting**: If we used a more complex model or tuned the parameters excessively, we might risk overfitting, which could hurt generalization on unseen data.
- **Feature Engineering**: The dataset is simple, and no feature engineering was necessary. However, for more complex datasets, itâ€™s crucial to understand the features and possibly create new ones.
- **Outlier Handling**: The Iris dataset does not contain significant outliers, but in more complex datasets, handling outliers can be an essential step to improve model performance.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Try Non-Linear Kernels**: Although the linear kernel worked well here, it may be beneficial to experiment with **RBF** (Radial Basis Function) or other non-linear kernels on more complex datasets to improve classification accuracy.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: You can optimize the performance of the SVM by tuning hyperparameters such as the **C** parameter (regularization), the **kernel** type, and others using techniques like **Grid Search** or **Randomized Search**.

3. **Cross-Validation**: Instead of splitting the data into just one training-test split, consider using **k-fold cross-validation** to better assess the modelâ€™s performance and avoid overfitting.

4. **Extend to Other Datasets**: This classification approach works well with the Iris dataset. However, applying the same methodology to more challenging datasets can be a good learning experience.

---

## Conclusion

In this project, we successfully built a classification model to identify Iris flower species using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. By following the typical steps of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, we achieved outstanding results. The model demonstrated a perfect classification accuracy on the Iris dataset, showing that SVM is a powerful and reliable tool for multi-class classification tasks.
